		Bring in the pictures

		generate Sigma matrix and save that
			generate random gausian distribution matrix (Sigma, W(0))
			parameters:
				dimensions of desired gausian random matrix
			output numpy matrix

	for each picture calculate the y_t vectors

		write the Z_t update functions
write the W update functions
write code to recover x_t's from z_t's

write code to quantify the correctness of the code
